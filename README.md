# Address-Book-Application
  - Develops an application to prompt users for address book and index files, leveraging event-driven programming through action listeners for users to manipulate data efficiently
  - Designs a binary search algorithm for efficient retrieval of contact records, offering rapid search capabilities for large datasets

# Project Title: Address Book Management System

Description: Developed an Address Book Management System using Java Swing, incorporating advanced features such as file handling, binary search, and random access to efficiently manage and retrieve contact information. The graphical user interface (GUI) includes input fields for surname, given names, street address, city, and state. Additionally, the system allows users to navigate through the address book using navigation buttons like "First," "Next," "Previous," and "Last." The "Find" button triggers a binary search algorithm to locate and display specific entries based on user input.

Key Features:

File Handling
  - Implemented a file selection mechanism using Java's FileDialog to choose both the Address Book and Index files.
  - Utilized RandomAccessFile for efficient reading and writing of data in a non-sequential manner.

GUI Components
  - Developed a user-friendly GUI with input fields for contact information (surname, given names, street address, city, state).
  - Implemented navigation buttons ("First," "Next," "Previous," "Last") to facilitate easy browsing through the address book.
  - Incorporated buttons for "Find," "Add," "Delete," and "Update," enhancing the functionality of the system.

Binary Search Algorithm
  - Designed and implemented a recursive binary search algorithm to efficiently locate entries in the address book based on user input.
  - Ensured case-insensitive comparison to enhance user experience.

Achievements:
  - Successfully implemented a comprehensive Address Book Management System with a user-friendly interface.
  - Demonstrated proficiency in file handling, random access, and binary search algorithms in a Java environment.
  - Enhanced user navigation through the address book with intuitive buttons and efficient search capabilities.

Lessons Learned: This project provided hands-on experience in GUI development, file handling, and algorithm implementation. The utilization of random access and binary search showcased efficiency in managing large datasets. The project enhanced problem-solving skills and deepened understanding of Java's capabilities for developing robust applications
